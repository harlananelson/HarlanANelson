This is a list of the software I use every day but is not currently included in my Windows virtual machine image. Note that
the VM I log into is Windows.  
My goal is to create a `docker` image with these in it.

1. *Docker*
1. Install the image with all my *linux* programs.  

In the case where *Docker* is not used, here are the windows progams:

1. *R*: [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
1. [*RStudio*](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
1. [Download Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
