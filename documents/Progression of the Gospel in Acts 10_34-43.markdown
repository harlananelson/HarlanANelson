# Progression of the Gospel in Acts 10:34–43

*Acts 10:34–43* marks a pivotal moment in the spread of the gospel, as Peter declares God’s impartiality and preaches to Cornelius, the first Gentile convert, leading to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and baptism of Gentiles. This passage reflects the culmination of Peter’s journey in understanding and proclaiming the gospel to all nations.

## Progression of the Gospel in Peter’s Life

The gospel spreads through Peter’s ministry in distinct stages, each expanding its reach from Jews to Gentiles, fulfilling the promise of Acts 1:8: “You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” Below are the key steps leading up to Acts 10:35.

### Pentecost (Acts 2:14–41)
- **Scripture**: “And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” (Acts 2:21, quoting Joel 2:28–32).
- **Context**: The gospel begins with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in Jerusalem. Peter preaches to a Jewish audience, including “Jews and proselytes” (Acts 2:10–11), during the festival. The Holy Spirit empowers the apostles, and Peter’s sermon leads to 3,000 conversions (2:41).
- **Significance**: The gospel is initially for Jews and proselytes (Gentiles who converted to Judaism, including circumcision for males). The apostles, as authoritative witnesses, proclaim Jesus as Messiah. The universal language (“everyone who calls”) hints at a broader scope, but Peter’s focus remains on Jewish hearers.
- **Geographical Scope**: Jerusalem.

### Sermon at Solomon’s Portico (Acts 3:11–26)
- **Scripture**: “Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed” (Acts 3:25, quoting Genesis 12:3, 22:18).
- **Context**: After healing a lame man at the temple, Peter addresses a Jewish crowd in Jerusalem, proclaiming Jesus as the fulfillment of prophecy. He calls for repentance and references the Abrahamic promise, which includes “all peoples.”
- **Significance**: Peter’s sermon reinforces the gospel’s Jewish roots but acknowledges its universal destiny. His audience is still Jewish, but the mention of “all peoples” foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles, though Peter does not yet act on this.
- **/Geographical Scope**: Jerusalem.

### Before the Sanhedrin (Acts 4:8–12, 5:29–32)
- **Scripture**: “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12).
- **Context**: Peter defends his actions before Jewish leaders after healing and preaching. He boldly declares Jesus as the only source of salvation and, later, as the exalted Savior for Israel (5:31).
- **Significance**: The universal term “mankind” in 4:12 suggests salvation extends beyond Jews, but Peter’s ministry remains focused on Israel. His courage in proclaiming Jesus to hostile authorities shows his commitment to the gospel, preparing him for future challenges.
- **Geographical Scope**: Jerusalem (Judea).

### Samaritans (Acts 8:14–25)
- **Context**: Philip preaches in Samaria, leading to conversions. Peter and John are sent from Jerusalem to confirm the work, praying for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit (8:15–17).
- **Significance**: Samaritans, though partially Jewish in heritage, were despised by Jews. Peter’s involvement marks the gospel’s expansion beyond Judea to a marginalized group. This step stretches Peter’s cultural boundaries, though Samaritans are not fully Gentile, and the mission is initiated by Philip, not Peter.
- **Geographical Scope**: Samaria.

### Simon the Tanner (Acts 9:43)
- **Context**: After miracles in Lydda and Joppa (healing Aeneas and raising Dorcas), Peter stays in Joppa with Simon, a tanner. Tanners handled dead animal skins, making them “unclean” in Jewish culture.
- **Significance**: Peter’s choice to stay with an “unclean” Jew signals a softening of cultural barriers. This prepares him for the vision in Acts 10:9–16, where God challenges distinctions between clean and unclean, paving the way for his encounter with Cornelius.
- **Geographical Scope**: Judea (Joppa).

### Cornelius (Acts 10:1–48)
- **Context**: Peter, prompted by a vision and the Spirit, visits Cornelius, a God-fearing Gentile centurion in Caesarea. He preaches the gospel, the Holy Spirit falls on the Gentiles, and they are baptized.
- **Significance**: This is the gospel’s breakthrough to uncircumcised Gentiles, fulfilling the “ends of the earth” mandate. Peter’s realization in 10:34–35 that God shows no favoritism marks a theological and personal shift, as he embraces Gentiles as equals in Christ.
- **Geographical Scope**: Caesarea (representing the Gentile world).

## Peter and Cornelius

### “I Now Realize That God Does Not Show Favoritism”
In Acts 10:34, Peter declares, “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism.” This statement contradicts the prevailing view of the Jewish church that God favored Jews and their religion above others. The vision (10:9–16) and the Spirit’s guidance (10:19–20) reveal that God accepts people from every nation, challenging Peter’s ingrained cultural and religious assumptions. This marks a shift from his earlier ministry, which focused on Jews and proselytes, to a broader understanding of God’s impartial love.

### “In Every Nation the Person Who Fears Him and Does What Is Right Is Welcomed Before Him”
Cornelius exemplifies this truth (Acts 10:35). He is described as:
- **God-fearing**: Devout and reverent toward the God of Israel.
- **Charitable**: Generous to the needy, earning respect among Jews (10:22).
- **Prayerful**: Regular in prayer, seeking God’s will.

**Does God ask us to follow Cornelius’s example?**  
Cornelius’s qualities—reverence for God, generosity, and prayer—are virtues God values in all people. However, the text emphasizes that Cornelius still needed to hear the gospel and believe in Jesus for salvation (Acts 10:43, 15:7–9). His example encourages believers to cultivate a heart open to God and compassionate toward others, but faith in Christ remains the ultimate requirement for justification.

## Jesus in Peter’s Sermon (Acts 10:36–43)
Peter’s sermon to Cornelius summarizes the gospel:
- Jesus was **anointed by God with the Holy Spirit and power** (10:38).
- He **healed people oppressed by the devil**, demonstrating God’s presence (10:38).
- He was **killed on a tree** (crucified, 10:39).
- **God raised him** on the third day (10:40).
- He was **seen by God’s chosen witnesses**, who ate and drank with him (10:41).
- His witnesses are **commanded to preach** that Jesus is appointed to **judge both the living and the dead** (10:42).
- **Everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins** through his name (10:43).

This message, consistent with Peter’s earlier sermons (Acts 2, 3, 4), now extends to Gentiles, affirming that salvation through Jesus is universal.

## Giving of the Holy Spirit to Uncircumcised Gentiles
While Peter speaks, the Holy Spirit falls on all who hear, including uncircumcised Gentiles (10:44–46). This astonishes the circumcised believers with Peter, as it challenges their assumption that only Jews or circumcised proselytes could receive the Spirit. Proselytes, who underwent circumcision to convert to Judaism, might have been particularly upset, as the event proves circumcision is not necessary for God’s acceptance.

The Spirit’s outpouring mirrors Pentecost (Acts 2), showing that God, who gave the Spirit to Jesus (10:38) and the apostles, now gives it freely to Gentiles. This divine act validates their inclusion in the church without Jewish mediation.

## Baptism
Peter orders water baptism for the Gentiles, declaring, “Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have” (10:47). Baptism signifies their full incorporation into the Christian community.

**Modern Context**: Some “Full Gospel” churches emphasize speaking in tongues as a “second blessing” post-conversion, viewing it as evidence of the Holy Spirit. In Acts 10, however, tongues accompany the Spirit’s initial outpouring, not a separate event, and water baptism is the culminating act of conversion. This suggests baptism, not tongues, was the primary marker of inclusion in the early church.

**Peter’s Boldness**: The Jerusalem church, rooted in Jewish tradition, would likely have been unhappy with Peter baptizing uncircumcised Gentiles. Peter’s rhetorical question (“Can anyone keep these people from being baptized?”) reflects his conviction, driven by the Spirit’s evidence. Known for bold, sometimes rash actions—walking on water (Matthew 14:28–29), cutting off a guard’s ear (John 18:10), lingering in the courtyard during Jesus’ trial (Luke 22:54–62)—Peter takes a risk here. His decision invites scrutiny, as seen in Acts 11:1–18 and 15:7–11, where he defends his actions to Jewish believers.

## Questions for Reflection
1. **Are we willing to take risks, facing scrutiny from the church or peers, to follow God by not showing favoritism?**  
   Peter’s example challenges believers to cross cultural, racial, or social boundaries to share the gospel, even if it means discomfort or criticism. Embracing God’s impartiality may require bold actions that challenge church traditions or peer expectations.

2. **How should the church respond to individuals acting independently for God’s purposes? How can the church make proper judgments?**  
   The early church faced this with Peter’s actions in Acts 10. Acts 11:1–18 shows a model: the Jerusalem believers listened to Peter’s account, weighed the evidence of the Spirit’s work, and accepted God’s inclusion of Gentiles. Churches today should balance discernment with openness, testing actions against Scripture and the Spirit’s guidance while avoiding rigid traditionalism. Proper judgment involves humility, dialogue, and a focus on God’s mission.
