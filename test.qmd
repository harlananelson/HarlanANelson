# Non-Standard Evaluation in R with `rlang`

## Introduction

Non-standard evaluation (NSE) is a powerful feature in R that allows you to manipulate code expressions instead of just their evaluated values. This is particularly useful when writing functions that interact with variable names or expressions, such as data manipulation functions in the tidyverse. The `rlang` package provides modern tools for NSE, commonly referred to as **tidy evaluation**, which make writing such functions safer and more intuitive.

This document explains non-standard evaluation in R, focusing on the `rlang` package and its applications within the tidyverse ecosystem.
