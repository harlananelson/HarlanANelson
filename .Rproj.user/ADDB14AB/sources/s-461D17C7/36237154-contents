These are the steps I used to get my web site running.

1. Use RStudio and `blogdown` to create the computer instructions for the site.
2. Use *github* to store those computer instructions on the internet
3. Use *Netify* to host and build the website
4. Use *Godaddy* to register the domain (would just use an registerar)
