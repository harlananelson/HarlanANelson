# About Me

I'm Harlan Nelson -- a hands-on problem solver and big-picture thinker who thrives on spontaneity and innovation. I approach life and work as an improviser, finding creative solutions while embracing new challenges and opportunities.

## My Values and Approach

- **Risk-Taker:** I believe growth comes from stepping outside comfort zones and taking calculated risks.
- **Listener and Collaborator:** I value close-knit relationships and casual conversations that spark meaningful ideas.
- **Self-Taught Explorer:** I'm constantly seeking breadth over depth, enjoying the journey of learning new skills and exploring diverse fields.

## How I Work

I've spent my career turning messy healthcare data into something clinicians can act on. That means building cohorts from claims and EHR data, training models that respect the messiness of real-world evidence, and presenting results in ways that non-technical stakeholders can trust.

My current focus is sickle cell disease -- a condition where better data science can directly improve patient outcomes. I build mortality prediction models, risk stratification systems, and analytical frameworks that help researchers ask better questions about treatment effects.

I believe in working in the open where possible, building tools that others can use, and writing analyses that document not just *what* was done but *why* each decision was made.

## Lifestyle and Inspiration

- **Nature Enthusiast:** I draw energy and inspiration from the outdoors, preferring natural landscapes over cityscapes.
- **Minimalist:** I focus on what truly matters, simplifying life to create space for what's most meaningful.
- **Future-Oriented Dreamer:** I'm always envisioning what's next, dreaming big while remaining grounded in my values.
