# About Me

Hello! I'm Harlan Nelson, a hands-on problem solver and big-picture thinker who thrives on spontaneity and innovation. I approach life and work as an improviser, finding creative solutions while embracing new challenges and opportunities.

## My Values and Approach

- **Risk-Taker:** I believe growth comes from stepping outside comfort zones and taking calculated risks.  
- **Listener and Collaborator:** I value close-knit relationships and casual conversations that spark meaningful ideas.  
- **Self-Taught Explorer:** I’m constantly seeking breadth over depth, enjoying the journey of learning new skills and exploring diverse fields.  

## Lifestyle and Inspiration

- **Nature Enthusiast:** I draw energy and inspiration from the outdoors, preferring natural landscapes over cityscapes.  
- **Minimalist:** I focus on what truly matters, simplifying life to create space for what’s most meaningful.  
- **Future-Oriented Dreamer:** I’m always envisioning what’s next, dreaming big while remaining grounded in my values.
