# TxtArchive

## Summary

A Python command-line tool that creates text-based archives of codebases. It supports two formats: a standard format for exact file reconstruction, and an LLM-friendly format optimized for AI analysis. Jupyter notebooks are flattened into readable cell-by-cell representations.

## Features

- **Standard format:** Preserves exact file structure for reconstruction
- **LLM-friendly format:** Table of contents, clear file separators, stripped outputs -- optimized for context windows
- **Jupyter support:** Notebooks rendered as markdown cells + code cells, outputs optionally stripped
- **Selective archiving:** Filter by file type or specify explicit file lists
- **Round-trip capable:** Archives can be unpacked back to working files

## Usage

```bash
# Create LLM-friendly archive
python -m txtarchive archive myproject/ output.txt \
    --file_types .py .ipynb .qmd .R \
    --llm-friendly --extract-code-only

# Unpack archive
python -m txtarchive unpack archive.txt output_dir/

# Extract notebooks from archive
python -m txtarchive extract-notebooks archive.txt output_dir/
```

## Why This Exists

Working with AI coding assistants often requires sharing entire project contexts. Copy-pasting files is tedious and error-prone. TxtArchive creates a single, self-contained text file that an LLM can ingest as context -- with a table of contents and clear file boundaries.
