# SCD Mortality Prediction

## Summary

Building random forest models to predict 5-year mortality in sickle cell disease patients using electronic health record data from multiple health systems. The project uses multi-site external validation (Cerner training, IU Health external) and SHAP-based interpretation to identify the clinical features most predictive of patient risk.

## Key Methods

- **Algorithm:** Random forest (ranger) via tidymodels, with tuned hyperparameters (mtry=11, min_n=20)
- **Validation:** 80/20 train/test split + independent IU Health external validation
- **Interpretation:** SHAP values (kernelshap + shapviz) for individual and global feature importance
- **Threshold:** Youden's J index for optimal classification with low-prevalence outcomes
- **Calibration:** Assessed via calibration plots and Brier score

## Features

Over 100 predictors drawn from:

- Demographics (age, gender)
- SCD comorbidities (pulmonary hypertension, CKD, stroke, acute chest syndrome)
- Laboratory values (creatinine, hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, LDH)
- Procedures (echocardiography, spirometry, imaging)
- Medications (hydroxyurea duration and usage)

## Status

Active development through the 300-series analysis notebooks (300-335), with ongoing work on risk stratification and clinical narrative. The model achieves clinically meaningful discrimination with interpretable feature importance aligned to known SCD pathophysiology.

## Role Context

This work is part of a grant-funded project at Indiana University Health under Dr. Gerard Hills, focused on translating EHR data into clinically actionable risk models for sickle cell disease.
