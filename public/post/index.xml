      <description> These are the steps I used to get my web site running.
Use RStudio and blogdown to create the computer instructions for the site. Use github to store those computer instructions on the internet Use Netify to host and build the website Use Godaddy to register the domain (would just use any registerar)  </description>

      <description>Git Hub and Azure Ropository are moving away from passwords to other means of authentication. There are a few ways to authenticate:
 Personal Access Tokens (PAT) embedded in your app.
 Token keys used by SSH. Two step identification. Use of PATs as passwords entered when authentication is needed.  The PATs are used in applications that access accounts such as your repositories. The PAT is stored securely in the app and then used for authentication.</description>
